# Brando’s Software Engineer Journey

I’m working toward becoming a software engineer. I’m still learning what the craft takes, but I’m dedicated to mastering the fundamentals and building real projects. I plan to keep learning consistently and improving every week until I’m job-ready.

## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in JavaScript and web development
- Ship real projects (not just tutorials)
- Develop the skills to land a remote-friendly software engineering role

## Progress Log
- Week 0: First JavaScript file (`index.js`) – console output test

index.js

console.log("Brando is building the future.");

Week 0: first JavaScript file
